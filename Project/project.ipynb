    "A computer is a machine that has been made and programmed to do a sequence of arithmetic or logical operations automatically [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer). most modern day electronics can preform a set of programs these programs allows computer to do a wide range of tasks like calculating basic maths to storing data on the device. A computer system is mostly made of components this includes a hardware, operating system and a peripheral device to see what is going on a basic personal computing setup you can buy these days are an example of that. The term computer was given to humans who could do numerical calculations using mechanical calculators [[3]](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/computer.htm)"

Quantum mechanics came up gradually from theories to expain observations that could not come to term with classic physics."

    "Superposition is the quantum system being able to be in multiple states at the same time until it is measured[[5]](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/superposition#:~:text=Superposition%20is%20the%20ability%20of,the%20English%20physicist%2C%20Thomas%20Young) and Quantum interference is when subatomic particles interact with and influence themselves and other particles while in a superposition state meaning it can influence the probability of the outcomes when the quantum state is measured.Now going back to quantum computing the use of it would be for machine learning and the simulation of physical systems.The eventual theorzised use for it could be fore solving problems that are currently impossible to solve[[6]](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/quantum-interference#:~:text=Quantum%20interference%20is%20when%20subatomic,the%20quantum%20state%20is%20measured)"

    "To explain what Quantum alogorithms are I first have to explain what an algorithm is. An algorithm is a step by step procedure to prefom a calculation or it can be a sequence of intructions to solve a problem where each step can be done a computer. A quantum algorithm is just an algorithm that was one of it steps being defined at quantum like using superposition. Quantum algorithms are described by Quantum circuits [[7]](https://www.quantum-inspire.com/kbase/what-is-a-quantum-algorithm/) a quantum circuit is model for quantum computation the steps to solve the problem are quantum gates preformed on one or more qubits. A quibit is short for quantum bit it is a bit that can either have the value of 0 or 1."
