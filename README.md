# G00392239_Emer_Tech_Proj

## Overview
Welcome to my Emerging technologies Project this is a project using jupyter notebook that contains code and documentation to explore deutschs algorithm along side that you will find a couple of tasks addressing a specific topic or problem.

## Table of Contents

1. [Tasks](#tasks)
    - The Collatz Conjecture Problem
    - Approximating Square Roots
    - Counting Possible Functions
    - Matrix Multiplication
  
2. [Project](#project)

---

## Getting Started

To run the notebooks locally or explore the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/emerging-technologies.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd emerging-technologies
    ```

3. Install the required packages if you haven't already. You can use Anaconda, a popular package manager and environment manager, to create a virtual environment and install the necessary packages.

    - **Anaconda Installation (if not installed):**

      If you don't have Anaconda installed, you can download it from the official website: [Anaconda Downloads](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)

4. Install Required Packages (Qiskit, NumPy):

      With the virtual environment activated, you can install the required packages using pip:

      ```bash
      pip install qiskit numpy
      ```

5. Open Jupyter notebooks:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Project Structure

- `Tasks.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook focusing on specific tasks provided within the project.
- `Projects.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing project-related code and documentation on Deutschs Algorithm.
