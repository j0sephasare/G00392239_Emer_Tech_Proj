# G00392239_Emer_Tech_Proj

## Overview
Welcome to my Emerging technologies Project this is a project using jupyter notebook that contains code and documentation to explore deutschs algorithm along side that you will find a couple of tasks addressing a specific topic or problem.

## Project Structure

- `Tasks.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook focusing on specific tasks provided within the project.
- `Projects.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing project-related code and documentation on Deutschs Algorithm.

## Tasks

### Task 1.0: Collatz Conjecture
- Explore the Collatz Conjecture, a mathematical problem.

### Task 2.0: Finding the Square Root using Newton's Method
- Discuss and implement finding square roots using Newton's method.

### Task 3.0: Number of Possible Functions with Four Bits
- Investigate the number of possible functions taking four bits as input and outputting a single bit.

### Task 4.0: Matrix Multiplication on Two Rectangular Lists
- Implement matrix multiplication on two rectangular lists.


### Deutsch's Algorithm
- Introduction to Deutsch's Algorithm in quantum computing.
- Explanation of the algorithm, its foundations, and problem statement.
- Code implementation and simulation.


## How to Run

To execute the provided code and explore the project, follow these steps:

1. Open the `Project.ipynb` notebook.
2. Execute each cell in order to see the results and visualizations.
3. Similarly, you can explore specific tasks in the `Tasks.ipynb`.
